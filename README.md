# Sudoku

A web application for creating and solving different types of sudoku.

## TODO/TOFIX
- Localization.
- Timer.
- Checker.
- Double-click on cell to select similar cells.
- Keep the progress when refreshing/duplicating the tab + restart button.
- Setter mode.
- Rule text snippets.
- Warn about the progress when navigating to another hash (possibly by history API).
- 2-color solid chess pieces.
- Do something with the Ctrl+N bug for the knight (maybe use Alt instead?).
- Visual tooltips on the grid when hovering/clicking specific sudoku rules.
- Improve selection when dragging the mouse diagonally (don't include unwanted cells).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
